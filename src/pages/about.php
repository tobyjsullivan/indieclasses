			<p>Although we are not quite ready to tell you what Indie Classes is yet, we are happy to tell you who we are and what we're trying to do.</p>
<p>For over a year, we have been talking with all kinds of folks within the yoga community from studio owners, to teachers, to students to try and discover what's working and what isn't and where we can help out.</p>
<p>We now have a firm vision of what yoga looks like today and where we would like it to be tomorrow. Indie Classes will offer a giant leap in the right direction.</p>
